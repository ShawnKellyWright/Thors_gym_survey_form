This is my first required project from freeCodeCamp.org to earn my Responsive Web Design  Certification. <br>
For this project, I'm to build a survey form to collect data from users. <br>
I chose to make a fictional Thor's gym for theme. <br>

The following were the requirements that had to be met: <br>
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks <br>

1. You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title. <br>
2. You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description. <br>
3. You should have a form element with an id of survey-form. <br>
4. Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text. <br>
5. Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email. <br>
6. If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error. <br>
7. Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number. <br>
8. The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error. (depending on your browser) <br>
9. If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error. <br>
10. For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label". <br>
11. For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field. <br>
12. Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from. <br>
13. Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute. <br>
14. Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute. <br>
15. Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments. <br>
16. Inside the form element, you are presented with a button with id of submit to submit all the inputs. <br>
